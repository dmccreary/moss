## p5.js 2.x Upgrade: MicroSim Fixes Needed (2026-09-05)

A static scan of this repo's `docs/sims/` MicroSims found **5 sim(s)** using p5.js v1-only APIs that will break if upgraded to p5.js 2.x (the microsim-generator skill's templates now default to p5@2.3.2). Fix these before bumping this repo's MicroSims past p5@1.x.

- [ ] **acro-vs-pleuro** (`docs/sims/acro-vs-pleuro/`)
    - `acro-vs-pleuro.js` uses the old multi-control-point `bezierVertex(...)` call — v2 takes one control point per `bezierVertex()` call — chain multiple calls instead of packing several points into one; use `bezierOrder()` for a quadratic curve.
- [ ] **moss-growth-forms** (`docs/sims/moss-growth-forms/`)
    - `moss-growth-forms.js` uses the old multi-control-point `bezierVertex(...)` call — v2 takes one control point per `bezierVertex()` call — chain multiple calls instead of packing several points into one; use `bezierOrder()` for a quadratic curve.
- [ ] **moss-types-gallery** (`docs/sims/moss-types-gallery/`)
    - `moss-types-gallery.js` uses the old multi-control-point `bezierVertex(...)` call — v2 takes one control point per `bezierVertex()` call — chain multiple calls instead of packing several points into one; use `bezierOrder()` for a quadratic curve.
- [ ] **ph-scale-moss** (`docs/sims/ph-scale-moss/`)
    - `ph-scale-moss.js` uses the old multi-control-point `bezierVertex(...)` call — v2 takes one control point per `bezierVertex()` call — chain multiple calls instead of packing several points into one; use `bezierOrder()` for a quadratic curve.
- [ ] **water-transport-comparison** (`docs/sims/water-transport-comparison/`)
    - `water-transport-comparison.js` uses the old multi-control-point `bezierVertex(...)` call — v2 takes one control point per `bezierVertex()` call — chain multiple calls instead of packing several points into one; use `bezierOrder()` for a quadratic curve.
